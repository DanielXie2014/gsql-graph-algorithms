README for GSQL Algorithm Library
4/29/19

The GSQL Graph Algorithm Library is a collection of high-performance GSQL queries,
each of which implements a standard graph algorithm. Each algorithm is ready to be
installed and used, either as a stand-alone query or as a building block of a larger
analytics application.GSQL running on the TigerGraph platform is particularly
well-suited for graph algorithms:

* Turing-complete with full support for imperative and procedural programming,
 ideal for algorithmic computation.

* Parallel and Distributed Processing, enabling computations on larger graphs.

* User-Extensible.
  Because the algorithms are written in standard GSQL and compiled by the user,
  they are easy to modify and customize.

* Open-Source. Users can study the GSQL implementations to learn by
  example, and they can develop and submit additions to the library.


Library Structure
-----------------

You can download the library from github:
https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/tree/master/graph_algorithms

The library contains two main sections: Algorithms and Tests.

The Algorithms folder contains template algorithms and scripts to help you customize
and install them. There are two folders:
	templates/
		 contains template algorithms with some placeholder code
		and markers which need to be acted on by the installation script.

	examples/
		contains GSQL queries generated from the templates by the installation script.

The Tests folder contains small sample graphs that you can use to experiment with the
algorithms. In our online documentation, we use the test graphs to show you the expected
result for each algorithm. The graphs are small enough that you can manually calculate
and sometimes intuitively see what the answers should be.

Get Started
-----------
If you want to use one of the test graphs, load it before installing the algorithms:
See the README.test file in the tests folder


* Install Algorithms:
1) You should create a graph schema in GSQL first.
2) Change into the algorithms folder.
3) Run a installation script, i.e.,
   bash install.sh
   and answer the questions.

More detailed documentation and examples are available on the web at
