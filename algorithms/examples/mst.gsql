CREATE QUERY mst (VERTEX source) FOR GRAPH social {
/* Minimal Spanning Tree (MST)
Given an undirected graph, and a source vertex, print out a MST for the connected subgraph which contains the source vertex.
1. Start with a set A = {source vertex}
2. For all vertices in A, find another vertex y in the graph but not A which is connected to a vertex x in A such that the weight on the edge e(x,y) is the smallest among all such edges from a vertex in A to a vertex not in A. Add y to A, and add the edge (x,y) to MST
3. Repeat 2 until A has no edge linking to any other vertex in the graph.
The ACCM version shows display by default.
