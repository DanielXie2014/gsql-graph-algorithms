This script is used to evaluate the embedding results. We use the embedding vector as features to do a multi-label classification task.
In the multi-label classification setting, every node is assigned one or more labels from a finite set K. During the training phase, we observe
a certain fraction of nodes and their labels. The task is to predict the labels for the remaining nodes. This is a challenge task when K is large.
